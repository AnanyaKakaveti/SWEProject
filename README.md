Project name: jam. 
*still working on other potential names*

Project description: 
 Our idea is a type of social media web application focused on sharing music.  The user can upload/share one song of their choice per day and the song can be something that expresses how they are feeling that day, or to reccomend music to friends. Users can also follow people and react to others posts with reaction buttons.  The user can also include a caption for the song they post that day. If all the basic implementations are completed, we would like to also implement a feature that enables users to make a playlsit of their liked songs that connections have posted.
