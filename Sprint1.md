Our team plans to address the first user story for sprint 1 and create an issue so that the user can sucessfully register and login to view posts. We were able to complete the set up for the backend and frontend for this issue. When the user regiesters, our backend server is able to store the user information and dsiplay the message "user is loggin in" to show the cline and server are connected. Our team established a simple connection between the client and the server, with the click of a button, our next step is to get the backend to recieve the username and password. This would complete the user story 1 issue. Though it took us a while to learn our backend and frontend, our team is now familiar with handling the client and server and is looking to be able to catch up to speed.
