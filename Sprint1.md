Our team plans to address the first, fifth, and eigth user storys for sprint 1 and create an issue so that the user can sucessfully register and login to view posts. Additionally, we planned to complete the issue of developing a server conneciton and enabling the backend to be a functional component of our website.  At the same time, we planned to address the issue of creating a front end that is visually appealing and promote the vibe of the application to be a modern and music oriented site with functional buttons and inuitive components.  Our team also planned to create a connection to the main social media page when signing in as a returning or new user.    

We were able to successfully complete the set up for the backend and frontend for this sprint including the login, register and home pages. In essence, when the user regiesters, our backend server is able to store the user information locally outputting in the console and dsiplay the message "user is loggin in" to show the client and server are connected. Our team established a simple connection between the client and the server, with the click of the sign in button on the register page.  This was implmeneted with a websocket connection and coded in Go. By implementing bootstrap into our application, the user authentication proccess automatically prompts for new imput if a valid email address is not given.  Routes were also connected for the front end through React typescript, enableing the user to navigate through different pages of the site. 

Our next step is to get the backend to recieve the username and password in the fiber database. An issue we did not have the chance to complete was routing the user to a new page when signing in and effectively connecting the fiber database.  We did not complete these steps due to various reasons. A large time component of our work for this sprint was spent truly understanding the various different options of databases and technologies that we could use to implement all components we desire. By doing extensive research we decided to use React typescript and Go and finally decided to also use fiber as a database to store user information.  As a result of taking the necessary time to think through the choices for implementing the backend server we did not have a chance to connect it to our existing application and replace the existing websocket conection. We look forward to completing this for sprint two along with finding and connecting a proper music API that enables users to actually search for their song of the day and post it to the feed. We also hope to implement the feature of seeing other application users that have signed in through the user authentication.
